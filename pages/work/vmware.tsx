          <p>
            It’s the summer of 2018, Christopher Franco Monterrosa makes his
            first debut in the heart of Silicon Valley. He joins vmware’s Open
            Source Program Offiice (OSPO) in the Office of the CTO as a UI
            Developer Intern.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s the perfect followup from last summer&apos;s Software
            Engineering internship at Glassdoor - he gets to build an open
            source intelligence tool from scratch. We&apos;re talking about
            designing the database architecture, api endpoints, curating open
            source libraries, choosing the technical stack, designing the logo
            and coming up with the perfect name.
          </p>
          <p>The man is bringing big startup energy into this summer.</p>
          <p>
            With the intent of creating a tool to help encourage and empower
            VMware employees to contribute to third-party open source projects,
            he’s tasked with tracking the use and modifications of open source
            packages within vmware products and identifying individuals
            associated with those changes to ultimately identify opportunities
            to contribute upstream to those open source projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the help of his mentor, a team of Open Source Engineers, and
            Leaders in the Open Source community he creates “Benthos”.
          </p>
          <p>
            This story takes place throughout Christopher Franco Monterrosa’s
            internship, focusing on his Last Week.
          </p>
          <p>It begins on Day 4.</p>

            CHRISTOPHER FRANCO MONTERROSA, is wearing his signature Billy London
            blue pinstripe coat. His ocean of curls are tied in a bun to reveal
            eye lashes that only nature sold to him exclusively. He dons his
            dark whiskey dragon eyeglasses along with his trusty brown sun
            kissed Zara shoes reprising their role once again as his go to
            footwear.
          </p>
          <p>
            We&apos;re at the vmware parking lot, Franco is walking the concrete
            lines like a tightrope walker.
          </p>
          <p>He takes out his phone, to start his daily ritual.</p>
          <p>
            He opens up a video app and hits record, he starts spinning around
            and captures one of his intern apartmentmates in the background who
            looks like Ryan Gosling took on the role of a cryptographer.

            ANGLE ON FRANCO - He&apos;s been gifted an Open Source Program
            Office (OSPO) sweater. We see the OSPO logo, he tips his head back,
            closes his eyes and holds the sweater close to his heart.

            From far away we see a design tool program on Franco&apos;s external
            monitor, we briefly see the words &quot;Benthos&quot; on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Franco&apos;s eyes are sparkling, we see him looking at a browser
            page opened through his laptop - it&apos;s an open source project
            that&apos;s perfect for the tech stack he&apos;s been piecing
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            An uncapped 0.4mm blue Pilot G-TC-C4 pen sits beside his Midori MD
            notebook — we see hand drawn database architecture designs.
            He&apos;s ready to build.

          <p>
            While everyone&apos;s posters looks like phd research papers - his
            poster looks like it came straight out of an indie computer science
            zine with design illustrations made from scratch, with a pastel
            palette to match.
          </p>
          <p>The information architecture of the poster is immaculate.</p>

            It&apos;s early, no ones here. He has the expresso machine all to
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            He loads up the portafilter, with fresh grounds of coffee, moving it
            in slow concentric circles - the distribution is even.
          </p>
          <p>
            He tamps. The angle is perfect and perpendicular. The grounds are
            perfectly flat.
          </p>
          <p>He loads up the portafilter onto the expresso machine.</p>
          <p>
            We watch the expresso spout drip into a coffee mug. As expected the
            drip is smooth and evenly distributed.
          </p>
          <p>
            He&apos;s holding the steam wand and gently placing the nozzle into
            the milk filled pitcher, he tilts it — he turns the nob.

            He pours the steamed milk into the coffee mug creating his small
            moment of latte art.

            He closes his eyes and holds the mug close to his nose and gives it

            It&apos;s the last week of the internship — the architecture has
            been laid out, all data sources confirmed, identified and tested —
            all he needs is to build.
          </p>
          <p>
            Franco, is wearing his OSPO sweater, he&apos;s donning a set of
            noise-cancelling headphones.
          </p>
          <p>We hear no music.</p>
          <p>His hands are in the form a steeple. </p>
          <p>
            Conference room lights are off, with Palo Alto sun rays nowhere in
            sight. Only the glow from his laptop screen illuminates his face.
          </p>
          <p>
            He begins typing intensely into his text editor. No trackpad
            movements.
          </p>
          <p>He&apos;s using vim keybindings in his text-editor.</p>
          <p>His curser dances around the screen with minimal hand movement.</p>
          <p>He types</p>
          <p>:w</p>
          <p>presses enter</p>
          <p>
            He saves his work and brings up his terminal to run his code. He
            closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, reopens them.
          </p>
          <p>One line of text makes an appearance on his terminal</p>
          <p>The API call he just wrote is a success!</p>
          <p>A FLASH of verbose text takes over the terminaal screen.</p>
          <p>He takes a quick glance. Hands slip off from the keyboard.</p>
          <p>His forehead meets the conference room table.</p>
          <p>
            He slowly lifts his head up and looks at his empty coffee mug.
            It&apos;s time for a break, he grabs it and heads to the expresso
            machine for another round.

            Walking down the hall he remembers talking to one of the open source
            engineers about a similar issue they ran into once. As Franco is
            walking down the hall, he sees the Open Source Engineer. He slowly
            walks up to an olympic walking speed and peeks over their cubicle

            It contains diagrams and words. It&apos;s the blueprint to a new

            He looks at the screen, he looks at the paper - the diagrams, the
