          <p>
            This takes place between the winter of 2018 and the summer of 2019
            where Christopher Franco Monterrosa is hired as a Fullstack Engineer
            to help lead engineering initiatives at BlitzIQ - a Y Combinator
            (W19) backed startup, that provides a customer notes workspace for
            B2B sales teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Franco has two solid technical internships under his belt at this
            point. He knows what a successful company and team looks like and
            feels like. His previous venture taught him that it&apos;s not
            enough to make something work but also engineer scaling into the
            product.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there was a hat version of musical chairs, he was wearing every
            engineering hat till the last musical note. He streamlines the
            development pipeline, rearchitects the backend and frontend to
            suport scaling, and builds features on top of the rearchitecture,
            like a declaritive meeting template system.
          </p>
          <p>
            This story takes place at a critical juncture, before the
            rearchitecture - right after the company acquires their first pilot
            client - Dropbox.

            It begins in Berkeley, California, Christopher Franco Monterrosa has
            just finished a long day of work and school. He&apos;s used up every
            second that life has given him to stay in the UC Berkeley Moffit
            Undergraduate Library, but it&apos;s 12:27AM and the last BART train
            to get him home leaves at 12:30AM.

            FRANCO, mounted on his trusty steed - a black/red/white 2014
            Specialized Allez C2 road bike, has one foot mounted on a pedal,
            while the other is planted on the pavement. We catch a glimpse in
            the background of the words “Moffit” and “Free Speech Movement”
          </p>
          <p>
            He&apos;s wearing an oversized teal denim jacket, with two enamel
            pins attached on his left breast pocket - a bear with “Go Bears”
            written on it, the other a face of a cat.

          <p>He takes out a small rose gold smartphone.</p>
          <p>
            ANGLE ON SMARTPHONE - We briefly see 12:27AM from the locked screen.
            He opens up his music app, taps on a song. It&apos;s taking a while
            to load. Meanwhile he puts the phone on his right breast pocket,
            with the speaker facing up towards his face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Franco starts pedaling with the cadence of a Tour de France sprinter
            towards Free Speech Bikeway.
          </p>
          <p>The song finally loads.</p>

          <p>
            ANGLE ON FRANCO -- with the Valley of Life Sciences Building (VLSB)
            standing in the background, we hear gears shifting,the pressure of
            each pedal rotation echo’d by the FREE SPEECH BIKEWAY pavement.
            Franco zooms past the building, he is gausian blur in 22 speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            ANGLE ON Franco -- he&apos;s downshifting, exiting FREE SPEECH
            BIKEWAY, he makes a sharp right on WEST CIRCLE to avoid the patch of
            earthquake mosaic pavement that only his mind&apos;s eye can see. He
            turns onto UNIVERSITY DRIVE towards the direction of CRESCENT LAWN.
          </p>
          <p>
            ANGLE ON FRANCO -- he&apos;s accelerating towards CRESCENT LAWN
            turning left. Pedals stop rotating, he&apos;s holding his right
            pedal on its six. He and his trusty steed are pushing it beyond a 45
            degree lean.
          </p>
          <p>
            With 7 meters of red zoned curb cleared to work with. He counter
            steers.
          </p>
          <p>
            His tires, 3 Milimeters away from receiving a red highlight from the
            curb, begin to increase their distance away. He makes it.
          </p>
          <p>
            He continues down CRESCENT LAWN towards the intersection of OXFORD
            and CENTER ST.
          </p>
          <p>
            ANGLE ON FRANCO -- Franco&apos;s eyes are scanning the intersection
            left and right, he sees his Flamme Rouge - a Red Traffic Raised Hand
            BLINKING.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hear gears shifting one last time. Franco&apos;s hands slip down
            to the dropbars. His back is flat. This is his Tour de BART.
          </p>
          <p>
            ANGLE ON FRANCO -- Franco is coming toward us. He&apos;s entering

            SHATTUCK.

          <p>
            He crosses SHATTUCK, towards the Berkeley BART Downtown station
            entrance. He dismounts haphazardly. He swings his trusty steed on
            his right shoulder. It&apos;s his turn to be the ride.
          </p>
          <p>
            No one is on the escalator. He gladly accepts the midnight speed
