          <p>
            It&apos;s the Fall of 2019, Christopher Franco Monterrosa, has just
            finished leading engineering initiatives at an early stage Y
            Combinator backed startup as a Full Stack Engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now he wants to know what it takes to build a company that
            obtains a Series A.
          </p>
          <p>
            He joins Pathrise, a Y Combinator (18) backed startup. They are an
            online mentorship program that helps job seekers in tech find the
            best job possible through personalized and data-driven support.
          </p>
          <p>
            He gets hired as a software engineer intern, eventually taking up
            more responsibility to be the sole Software Engineer on the team
            towards the end of his tenure.
          </p>
          <p>
            He&apos;s part of an engineering team that mentors him, providing
            opportunities to grown and learn. He works with a Product Manager
            who is a PM Paragon — a golden gate bridge of product, design and
            engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Christopher Franco Monterrosa gets what he wants, he also
            unexpectedly gets what he needs — becoming a Series A Engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the words of his friend — he brings passion, innate leadership
            abilities, with an understanding of the greater business context and
            an eternal pursuit for great UX.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rearchitectures, refactors, devops, features, bugs and all — with
            ownership and a deep sense of curiosity — it&apos;s a memorable
            first full-time software engineering experience for Christopher
            Franco Monterrosa.
          </p>
          <p>
            This story takes place before the company gets their Series A - it
            focuses on Christopher Franco Monterrosa&apos;s journey on becoming
            a Series A Engineer.

            CHRISTOPHER FRANCO MONTERROSA, is wearing his black vmware OSPO
            (open source program office) sweater, with a denim button up
            underneath. His ocean of curls have become a frozen whirlpool bun -
            revealing his turquoise-brown rimmed glasses.
          </p>
          <p>He&apos;s sitting at a desk, we see his bright red backpack.</p>

            The lead engineer has left comments on his Pull Request. All her
            comments are on point, he needs to address those to earn his LGTM
            (looks good to me).

          <p>
            He glances at his monitor, it has a technical design doc he wrote -
            it shows architecture diagrams, tradeoffs to different approaches.

          <p>He switches over to his text-editor.</p>

            no backspace.

                Hey there — have you ever had to completely change the way
                people access your platform? As of a week ago, I didn&apos;t
                know how I would do it, but with an ounce of curiosity, I got a
                pound of code ready to ship.

          </div>

            With over a month of PRs (Pull Requests) under his belt, he deploys

            Franco is sitting on his couch cross-legged, donning his navy blue
            joggers and vmware OSPO (open source program office) black sweater,
            with a light blue denim button up - its become his uniform.
          </p>
          <p>
            His setup is a makeshift workstation, with a monitor stacked up on
            top of two thick textbooks

                Hello again, have you ever launched something on Product Hunt?
                If not, don&apos;t worry, neither have I! But what I&apos;m
                about to push will be making it&apos;s debut on my behalf

            We see Franco&apos;s face — he&apos;s smiling, his keyboard cadence
            a little faster than usual.

            We zoom out, it’s a full body mirror spanning across the whole room.

            Franco is sitting in a green wooden chair. We see a used surgical

                You know, the best type of performance optimizations, are the
                ones that support good design. This refactor shaves off a few
                seconds, and with a loading indicator to provide some system
                feedback, the waiting will feel more like progress and less like
                traffic on the bay bridge. UX driven engineering.

                These are a few of my favorite things. First, this part — as an
                engineer, you can build anything, but to build something you
                begin adding the contraints one by one — eventually you&apos;re
                sculpting a solution on the fly during the meeting.
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            We see Franco having a meeting through video chat with his Product
            Manager to go over deliverables, design and timelines
          </p>
          <div className={utilScriptStyles.scriptDialogueContainer}>
            <div className={utilScriptStyles.scriptDialogue}>
              <div className={utilScriptStyles.scriptActor}>FRANCO (V.O)</div>
              <div>
                Then, another favorite — the technical design doc. Not
                mandatory, but who doesn&apos;t love an origin story? A north
                star that grounds, shapes and helps facilitate present and
                future technical discussions.
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            He creates a technical design doc based on the meeting and begins
            typing.

            <div className={utilScriptStyles.scriptDialogue}>
              <div className={utilScriptStyles.scriptActor}>FRANCO (V.O)</div>
              <div>
                This is also my favorite part, especially for big features,
                it&apos;s providing a visual guide to understanding
                architectural changes.
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            He opens up his favorite design tool that starts with an F and

            Lead Engineer and CTO to get feedback on the proposed changes. It
